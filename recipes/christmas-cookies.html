      <p>
        Soft cut out sugar cookie that I have used for years. I sprinkle with
        colored sugar before baking or you could also try icing them when cool.

      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together, set aside. In a large
          bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy.
          Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Gradually
          blend in the sifted ingredients until fully absorbed. Cover dough, and
          chill for 2 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.
          On a clean floured surface, roll out small portions of chilled dough
          to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out shapes using cookie cutters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake 6 to 8 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges are barely
          brown. Remove from cookie sheets to cool on wire racks.
        </li>
      </ol>
